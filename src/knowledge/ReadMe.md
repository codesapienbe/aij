## Knowledge

This code defines a knowledge base represented as a dictionary in Python. The keys of the dictionary represent different topics, and the values associated with each key are lists of related terms or concepts.

The `knowledge_base` dictionary is initialized with several topics and their corresponding related terms. For example, the topic "artificial intelligence" is associated with the terms \["AI", "machine learning", "neural networks"\]. Similarly, "climate change" is associated with \["global warming", "greenhouse gases", "carbon emissions"\], and "COVID-19" is associated with \["coronavirus", "pandemic", "vaccine"\].

The `get_related_terms()` function takes a `topic` as an input and returns the related terms from the knowledge base. It checks if the `topic` exists as a key in the `knowledge_base` dictionary. If it does, it retrieves the corresponding list of related terms and returns it. If the `topic` is not found in the knowledge base, it returns an empty list.

The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It calls the `get_related_terms()` function with different topics and prints the results. In this case, it tests the function with three topics: "artificial intelligence", "COVID-19", and "space exploration". The related terms for each topic are printed on separate lines.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` condition ensures that the `main()` function is only executed if the script is run directly and not imported as a module. This is a common practice in Python to distinguish between running a script as the main program or importing it as a module into another script.
