This code is a Python script that collects text data from different sources, preprocesses the data, and combines it into a training dataset.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1.  The script imports the necessary modules: `requests` for making HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library for parsing HTML content, and `re` for regular expressions.
    
2.  The `extract_text` function is defined to extract text from a given webpage. It takes a URL as input, sends a GET request to the URL using `requests.get()`, and then uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content of the response. It finds all `<p>` tags in the HTML using `soup.find_all("p")` and retrieves the text content of each paragraph using `p.get_text()`. The extracted text is concatenated and returned.
    
3.  The `preprocess` function is defined to preprocess the extracted text. It takes the text as input and performs several operations using regular expressions (`re`) to clean the text. It removes URLs by substituting them with an empty string using `re.sub(r"http\S+", "", text)`. It removes special characters and digits by substituting them with an empty string using `re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", text)`. Finally, it converts the text to lowercase using `text.lower()`. The preprocessed text is returned.
    
4.  The `main` function is defined as the entry point of the script.
    
5.  The script collects data from news websites by providing a list of news URLs. It initializes an empty list `news_text` and iterates over each URL in `news_urls`. For each URL, it calls the `extract_text` function and appends the extracted text to the `news_text` list.
    
6.  Similarly, the script collects data from social media platforms and blogs by providing lists of social media URLs and blog URLs. It initializes empty lists `social_media_text` and `blog_text`, and iterates over the URLs in the respective lists, calling the `extract_text` function for each URL and appending the extracted text to the corresponding lists.
    
7.  After collecting the text data, the script preprocesses each text using the `preprocess` function. It uses list comprehensions to iterate over the `news_text`, `social_media_text`, and `blog_text` lists, calling `preprocess(text)` for each text and storing the preprocessed text back in the respective lists.
    
8.  Finally, the script combines the preprocessed text datasets by concatenating the `news_text`, `social_media_text`, and `blog_text` lists into a single list called `training_data`. The `training_data` list contains all the text data from the different sources.
    
9.  The `training_data` list is printed to the console.
    
10.  The `main` function is called if the script is executed directly (i.e., not imported as a module) by checking `if __name__ == "__main__"`.
    


In summary, this script collects text data from news websites, social media platforms, and blogs, preprocesses the data by removing URLs, special characters, and digits, and combines the preprocessed data into a training dataset stored in the `training_data` list.
